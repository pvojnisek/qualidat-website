TODO: We are working on the Julior Olympics qualification html page. I still found bugs in match data! Please review all matches carefully! (I clicked on Shres Black and checked the matches. First match is against Odin B at 2pm 13th June). other example: Shores Black vs. Shores Gold will not play, so there must be no date/time or vanue.

## Architecture

The website follows a simple static architecture:

- **index.html**: Main landing page with tournament schedule and navigation
- **Tournament pages**: Individual HTML files for specific tournaments (e.g., `20250607_KJVR_memorial_18U.html`, `20250613_16U_JOs_Quals.html`)
- **style.css**: Comprehensive CSS with water polo-themed styling, responsive design, and interactive elements
- **script.js**: JavaScript for animations, interactive stats, collapsible content, and hover effects

## Styling System

The CSS uses a cohesive water polo theme with:
- Blue gradient backgrounds (#0077be, #00a8cc, #4fc3f7)
- Card-based layout with hover animations
- Responsive grid systems for matches, standings, and statistics
- Collapsible sections for detailed tournament data
- CSS animations including wave effects and stat counter animations

## JavaScript Features

The script.js handles:
- Animated stat counters that count up when scrolled into view
- Hover effects for cards (match-card, fact-card, stat-card)
- Collapsible content functionality for tournament details
- Scroll-triggered animations

## Tournament Page Structure

Each tournament page follows a consistent structure:
- Hero section with tournament name and memorial information
- Tournament standings with medal indicators
- Match results in card format
- Statistics grids with animated counters
- Collapsible sections for complete match listings
- Fun facts about water polo
- Data source attribution

## Development Workflow

This is a static site with no build process or package management. Changes can be made directly to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The site uses modern CSS features and vanilla JavaScript without external dependencies.

## File Naming Convention

Tournament files follow the pattern: `YYYYMMDD_tournament_description.html` (e.g., `20250607_KJVR_memorial_18U.html`)

## Browser Compatibility

The site uses modern CSS features like CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS custom properties. JavaScript uses modern DOM APIs and should work in all current browsers.
